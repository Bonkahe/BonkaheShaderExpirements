# Free Godot 4 Shader/Visuals Experiments
This is just a collection of random Shader experiments I have created, mostly on a whim, larger experiments, like the clouds are pushed out to other repos, so these are just the little ones remaining.
Below is a list of experiments with explanation of them.

##  Water/Caustics

A surprisingly simple water shader and a companion light shader for things which go below the water, in order to simulate caustics.


##  Fire

Included is a shader to make any spherical object seem as if it's burning, I modeled this after a candle flame, so as a result it typically does best for single fire sources like torches or lamps, it also looks best with an object inside it like a wick or what have you.
I also threw together a simple script to handle movement and push a vector to the shader to make it seem as if it's a bit more physical.
